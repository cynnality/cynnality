# TODO 



12/4/24 
the modal is popping out to the bottom and i like it...
keep it this way and the pop up page could be split in 2 
the right side being a table (retro vibe, scroll bar etc)
left side being a "popup" with the picture and source picture (like previous card popup a bit)  
                              
                              
    **redo card page - all black (inspo picture in pinterest)
    -girl @ laptop dithered/stippled - added to left corner of card page
    -could be more of a motivational type thing (back to if i ruled the world, i'd consult
    these cards type beat).
